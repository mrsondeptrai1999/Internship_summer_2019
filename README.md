Son Ha - September 2019

My 2019 summer internship project file at the Big Data Institute (Oxford,UK). The project is about investigating the relationship between the geospatial factors and grey matter volume of the brain.
There is a powerpoint presentation 'Summary and presentation.pptx' which I include the background of the problem and my findings with graphs. I advise going through that file first.
